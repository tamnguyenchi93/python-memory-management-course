The last data structure or idea that we gotta cover when we think about how Python is working with small objects are arenas.
And arenas are 256 kilobytes of memory, they're allocated on the heap and they manage 64 pools.
You can see down here the data structure that defines them.
It's quite similar to the pools.
You've got doubly linked list.
You've got the next free one.
Things like that.
These arenas, this is the top level thing.
Arenas contain a bunch of pools.
Arenas are always the same size.
The pools are often the same size, the blocks that they contain, they might be different scale, they might be 8 byte objects, they might be 16 byte objects, though, you know, the second would only hold half as many as before, but that's the idea.
We've got arenas that control the pools, the pools hold the blocks, and the blocks are where the objects actually go with 8 byte alignment.
