Finally, I just want to wish you the best of luck on your projects.
I'm sure you're trying to solve some memory problems or make your programs more efficient and I hope what you've learned here has given you a better understanding of how everything works in Python, some of the techniques and patterns you can apply and the tools that you can use to get there.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for taking my course.
It's been great to spend the time with you talking about Python memory.
See you online.
Bye.
