If you want to follow along exactly what I'm doing, 
I'm going to be using PyCharm so you should use PyCharm too. 
It's a fantastic tool for writing python code and exploring it. 
However, if you don't want to, 
you can use other editors as well. 
That's fine. So, if you're going to use PyCharm, 
I recommend you just get the latest version and use that. They offer 
two versions. They offer the PyCharm Community Edition and The PyCharm Pro Edition. 
For what we're doing this course the community addition, the free open source edition is totally 
fine. There's one step where I say 
"let's see the CPU profile graph in PyCharm" 
and we spend about one minute on that. 
That requires the Pro Edition, which you can just look at the picture, 
you don't have to be able to run it yourself. 
Other than that, you're gonna be able to do everything with the free, open source 
Pycharm Community Edition. So, there's no real reason to not use it other than 
you just want to use another editor. 
I think this is a great one and you'll see me using it throughout the course. 
The best way to get PyCharm is to go to the JetBrains toolbox and get 
that installed and then use that to install either PyCharm Pro or PyCharm Community 
or both, and this will keep it up to date and let you know 
when there's new versions and let you roll back to different versions. It's a much nicer 
way to work with PyCharm and the JetBrains applications rather than just installing it 
directly. If you don't want to use PyCharm, which is fine, 
I recommend that you use Visual Studio Code. 
That's the other really good editor these days. 
Those two have, like 85%, 90% of the market share at this point. 
From what I can tell the recent surveys and so on, 
this is a great one. Just be sure that you install the Python extension or 
it's not going to do much for you. 
And you get that by clicking on this little button here and then the Python extension 
is the most popular one. Looks like it's been downloaded 55 million times when I 
took this screenshot, and I know it's much higher than that right now. 
So, two editor options, PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, 
PyCharm community free version will totally work for this course.
