When you think of the data structure that's gonna hold all of your data, you 
have to remember they're not all created equal. 
We saw that we could have a list. 
We could have a typed array, 
in the case of numbers, we can have Pandas data frames, 
we can have series, we can have NumPy 
arrays, we can have a list of classes, 
all of these things have benefits and drawbacks for the way we use them in our 
program, but they also have very different memory costs. 
For example, our simple little typed array was something like 10 times more efficient 
than storing those numbers in a list, 
which is still more efficient than using things like Pandas or classes. 
You may want to choose one of these more advanced data types because it does amazing 
stuff for you, but just be aware that there is a memory price to be paid for it.
