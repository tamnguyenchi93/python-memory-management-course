We started our conversation talking about the simulation that you're living in. This beautiful, 
clean world that is making everything easy for you. 
And we said, Look, if you really want to know how Python works and 
how Python Memory Management works, you've got to look beyond this beautiful and handy facade 
that Python has put up for us. 
We gotta take the red pill in Matrix nomenclature. 
So we took the red pill and we saw that even simple things like numbers, like 
42, in Python are really PyObject pointers, specifically PyLongObject pointers, 
and there's a whole bunch of stuff happening behind the scenes, 
even though there's this clean, simple programming language on top of it, 
that understand the mechanics of how it all works, 
like for the fact that numbers are pointers and allocated on the heap and managed by 
reference counting, we've got to look inside the CPython source code, 
which we did, and I gave you a bunch of short little links like, 
for example "bit.ly/cpythonlong", where you can jump over 
and see the entire file of source code, here.
