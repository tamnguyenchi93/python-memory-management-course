in this short chapter, we're going to talk about what you need to follow along 
with the course and to write code and play with the same tools that we're going 
to use. Now, right off the bat, 
Would it surprise you to know that you're gonna need Python for a Python memory management 
course? Of course you are. 
But I do want to point out that you're gonna need at least Python 3.6 if 
you want to run the code that we're using and if you want exactly what we're 
using in this course, we're using 3.8, specifically, 
3.8.5. These memory behaviors can change slightly from version to version, 
but they should be pretty stable in Python 3 at this point. 
But the syntax, things like F-strings and whatnot, 
we are using those, and those require Python 3.6 and beyond. 
So the code will not run without 3.6 so make sure you have that right version. 
Now, how do you know if you have the right version? 
Well, you go to command prompt or your terminal and type python3 -V 
in Mac os and on Linux, 
and hopefully you get something like 3.8.5 or higher. 
The screenshot when I took it was a little bit older, 
but you know, you get the idea. On Windows, 
you probably should type python space, 
Dash capital V. Now one of various things can happen here, 
especially on windows. On windows, what you might get is, 
it might say, Python 3, 
or it might say python 2. You might also have Python 3 
but your path might not have it first. 
If nothing at all comes out or the Windows Store opens, 
the newer versions of Windows 10 will try to go to the Windows Store and install 
Python for you if you type it. And that will happen usually if you just 
type Python or Python 3 by itself. 
But with this -V, if it says nothing, 
that means you don't really have Python installed. 
It's just this store shim that really should say "you don't have python installed", 
even with an argument. Nonetheless, 
that's what happens. So make sure that you get Python 3.6 or above ideally 
3.8 or above on your Windows machine or on Linux or Mac Os. 
Finally, if you don't have Python installed, 
there's all these varying recommendations of how you install it and how that changes over time, 
What the trade offs are. 
Personally, I installed Python 3 on my Mac using Homebrew and I installed Python 
three on Windows using Chocolatey. 
So, those are both systems package management systems for the operating system that lets you 
automatically upgrade to the next version just by saying Brew - 
upgrade or Chocolatey upgrade python Things like that, 
which is really, really cool. 
But there's a bunch of different ways and trade off, 
so I recommend you check out this Real Python article: 
realpython.com/installing-python/ and see what they say 
now, they say they're going to keep this up to date to try to keep up 
with the times or what the options are for installing python. 
So if you need to, have a look here.
