Graphing memory usage over time for Python applications with Memory Profiler couldn't be easier as long as you have matplotlib installed and you have memory_profiler installed.
You can go over and say "mprofile run" and give Python script name or application name, and it will generate one of those .memoryprofile.dat files, and then you can plot it.
You just say "mprof plot" it'll plot the latest one, and you get something that looks like this.
