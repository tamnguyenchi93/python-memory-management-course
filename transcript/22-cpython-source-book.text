If you're a fan of this red pill type of thinking, 
you should definitely check out Anthony Shaw's CPython internals. 
I've had him on the podcast a couple times to talk about it, 
and he's finally written it up as a book. 
So this, like 350 pages talking about all the CPython source code, 
how you can figure out, you know navigate where in the whole structure, 
different things are, like where the object headers vs the objects themselves and digging into 
a whole bunch of interesting things the parsers and whatnot. 
So if you want to dive into not just the memory side of C Python, 
which is what we're gonna still spend a lot of time on, 
if you want to look at the whole thing, 
the parsers, the execution and everything, you know, 
check out Anthony's book. It's definitely good, recommend it.
