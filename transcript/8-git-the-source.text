You want to get the materials, 
the source code and whatnot data files for this course. 
You could pretty much type them in as you go, 
but if you want to play with it and tweak it, 
there's a lot of little ideas where you just make a small change and you see 
what happens in terms of the memory 
usage or the performance or whatever, 
so I definitely recommend that you get the source material, 
so go over here to github.com/talkpython/python-memory-management-course. 
If you're a friend of Git and you like to work with it, 
just go clone this repo. If you don't really know about Git and your uncomfortable doing 
it, you don't have to clone it. 
Officially, you can just click the green button where it says "code" and download 
It as a zip file and roll with that, right? 
There's no major changes or whatever we expect other than bug fixes along the way. 
Make sure you get the source code and take it with you. 
In fact, I recommend you fork and star it, 
just so you have it for sure. Alright, that's it. 
Go through these steps. You should be all set up and ready to take this 
course. I'm excited to dive into python memory management with you.
