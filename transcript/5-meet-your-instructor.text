finally, let me introduce myself.
Hey there, I'm Michael.
You can find me over on Twitter, where I'm @mkennedy.
You may know me from the podcasts "talk python to me" or the podcast "Python bytes".
I have done both of those.
And I'm also the founder and one of the principal authors here at Talk Python Training, and I'm super excited that you're in my class.
Thank you so much for taking it and I hope you really get a lot out of it, so, let's get started right now.
