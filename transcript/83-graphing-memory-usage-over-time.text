Well, having that printout and showing line by line 
how the memory is changing, is interesting, 
but it's also useful to know how the memory changes over time. And 
you know, a picture is worth 1000 words, 
as they say. So let's go make some pictures. 
What we can do is we can come down here and we can use this "mprof" 
command. So mprof does a bunch of things. 
One, You can see is plot, and you can say list, 
but the one we care about is Run, given command or Python files. So we'll say "mprof 
run", actually, we want to go into the right directory 
first. There we go, that'll make it easier. 
"mprof run" this one file. 
Let's see what we get. Takes a moment. Sampling 10 times a second. 
And it's done because of our little decorator, 
it prints out this stuff, but if you didn't have the decorator, 
you could still totally do this, 
you don't need this part at all. 
You just get slightly different outputs. Now, 
PyCharm is saying "Oh, we found a new file, 
maybe we should add here", and we could see what that is, as if we 
say "mprof list", like this. 
We'll say "here's the ones that we ran", 
but most significantly, most relevant here, 
is we can say "plot". Now, very likely this will fail. 
Let's see what happens. No module named PyLab. Hmmm. 
Well, what do we do here? 
Let's try this. Nope, that didn't work either. 
Well, maybe a better error message would be relevant here. 
But what we need to do is we need to have "matplotlib" 
if what we're gonna do is try to graph it, 
Okay? So then we can just say "pip install -r requirements" like that. 
Alright, with that installed, 
let's give it another shot. Beautiful, 
beautiful! Alright, here's an interactive matplotlib that will let us zoom in 
and check out all sorts of stuff. 
Go back to the regular graph, 
but here we can see it starting up. 
It's taking more and more memory. 
Here must be the completion of load_data, 
here's filter_data, and here's scale_data. You can see at the top that 
were up here around 94.8 megabytes of memory usage. 
You can do things like set the title and stuff up here, but not super relevant to 
us. You can use this little control bar, right? 
Standard matplotlib type of things, 
but nonetheless, here's a cool graph, 
and probably the most relevant is just, 
you know, save this as a PNG that you could go work on. So we 
can get these cool graphs and all we had to do to get them 
was go over here and say, 
"mprof run, mprof plot". by default, 
it will plot the latest one, 
but if you have a bunch of these mprofile files laying around, 
you can actually tell it which one you'd like to graph, 
put them side by side, all those kinds of things.
