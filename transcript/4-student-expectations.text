What are the prerequisites to take this course as a student, 
what do you need to know? 
Honestly, the requirements are really, 
really simple. You just need to be familiar with the Python programming language. 
We obviously don't start from scratch. 
We're digging into the internals of CPython. 
We're talking about the trade-offs of different data structures that you should already know from Python. 
So, you should be familiar with dictionaries, lists, 
the ability to create classes, functions, and then the core stuff like list comprehension 
and loops and whatnot. If those things are all in place for you, 
then you're absolutely ready to take this course. 
If not, check out our Python for the absolute beginner course as a great 
foundation, and then you'll be ready to jump in here.
