In this chapter, we're going to focus on Python classes and how they consume memory, 
and in particular some techniques that we can apply to make them more efficient. 
And you'll see some of those techniques, 
even, I'd say most these techniques, will make it not just more memory efficient, 
but also CPU speed faster. So things happen quicker just on a pure computational side 
as well as it's gonna use less memory. 
That's like a double win, isn't it? 
Everything we've learned so far about efficient data structures about functions and whatnot can layer on 
top of what we're going to talk about here, 
right? Functions can handle classes that can return them, internally the fields 
can store things in arrays instead of lists or those sorts of things. 
So think of this as just more goodness and more places 
you could make your program more efficient and better. 
So, let's dive in to classes.
