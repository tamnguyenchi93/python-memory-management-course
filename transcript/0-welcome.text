Welcome, Welcome, to Python Memory Management and tips.
This is a pretty unique course.
We're going to dive deep into the internals of python to understand how it works to make your code more efficient and make it faster.
I feel like python memory management is a bit of a black art.
We use python all the time, but most people don't really understand how python memory works.
How are python objects structured actually in memory in the runtime.
What does the reference counting part do? What does the garbage collection part do? we've heard maybe even you can avoid using the garbage collector altogether.
It's a bit of a black art.
Well, maybe not this kind of black art.
Maybe this kind of wizard.
Maybe this is the kind of black art, the programmer kind.
But if you really want to know how Python Memory works, this is a course for you.
We're gonna have a balance of high level conversations about algorithms, we're gonna dig into the CPython source code and we're going to write a ton of code to explore these ideas and see how they work in practice.
