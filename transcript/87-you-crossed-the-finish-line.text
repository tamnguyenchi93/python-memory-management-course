That's it. You've made it to the end of the course. 
You now know the black art of Python memory management. 
And I say black art because it's a little bit obscure and a little bit hidden 
and I feel like in the Python ecosystem, 
we talk less about the mechanics and the algorithms and heuristics of how memory is managed, 
than other languages and other ecosystems. 
I feel like the Java and .NET people obsess about the GC and tuning it 
and all that kind of stuff. 
And in Python, there's scarcely any information to be found about how this stuff works. 
So hopefully, throughout this course, 
you've learned a lot, and you have a better appreciation for how your programs run 
what you can do to be more or less efficient, 
and just a general appreciation of how memory works in Python. 
So in this final chapter, we're going to review what we've learned and just go 
quickly through some of the highlights of the course.
