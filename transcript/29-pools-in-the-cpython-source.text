Let's go back to the CPython source code and look at this idea of 
blocks, pools, and arenas. We haven't talked about arenas yet, 
but let's just look over there real quick. 
So I've come up with another Bitly URL for you, 
cause like, all of these are super long. 
So "biy.ly/cpythonpools", if you want to go there, and you 
might be surprised to see what you get when you come here. 
You don't get source code immediately. 
There is source code if you scroll enough, like here, 
there's some source code, but check this out. 
There's like a full on essay about what is happening around one of these pools. 
Okay, so if we go down a little bit 
further, it talks about how blocks are managed within the pools. 
So blocks in the pools are getting carved out as needed. 
The free block points to the start of a linked list of the free block, 
so you can always just go there and start allocating into that one. 
So pretty awesome, right? There's a bunch of stuff about, 
like things that they're doing that might be a little bit obscure, or what's unclear, 
and so why it's happening that way and so on. 
So when I was studying this I 
Was really surprised at the level of detail, 
describing how pools and blocks interact together. 
And if you want to see what the core developers and the 
people who worked on this and implement it and maintain it, 
what they say, Well, here it is, 
right in the source code on GitHub.
